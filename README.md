Hvplot and plotly express were used for visualizations in the crypto_clustering file.

## Process

- Data Preprocessing: Prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.

- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: Reduce data dimension using the PCA algorithm from sklearn.

- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means: Predict clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the KMeans algorithm from sklearn.

- Visualizing Results: Create some plots and data tables to present results.
